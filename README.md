# *Matrices*
This is my very first c# app that can create matrices and apply some simple operations on them

# *Inputs of the program*

**rows:** asking for number of rows you want for the matrix

**cols:** asking for number of columns you want for the matrix

inside the app you can choose the method you want to call on your matrices
but I will work on using them in runtime.
